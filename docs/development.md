## Development

The release requires Ruby version 2.4.4 and the Ruby gem Bundler (used by the vendoring script):

```
gem install bundler
```

With bundler installed, run the vendoring script:

```
./scripts/vendor_gems
```

Then create the BOSH release:

```
bosh create release --force
```

The release is now ready for use. If everything works, commit the changes including the updated gems.

### Manually run lifecycle tests

Our script uses terraform to prepare an environment on ec2 for lifecycle tests.
You must provide the proper access credentials as well as a KMS Key and Key
Pair fixture. Terraform will create all other required resources and destroy
them at the end of a successful test run. If tests fail, terraform will leave
the environment as is for debugging.

1. Create a `lifecycle.env` file containing the 4 required environment variables. The key
pair name must exist in the ec2 console; however, you do not need to have a copy
of it on your local system.
  ```bash
  export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAINSxxxxxxxxxxxxx
  export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=LvgQOmCtjL1yhcxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
  # Optionally use STS Tokens
  # export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=xxxxxxxx

  # Optionally use alternate region
  # export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-west-1
  ```
1. source your `lifecycle.env` file
  ```bash
  . ~/scratch/aws/lifecycle.env
  ```
1. Run tests
  ```bash
  src/bosh_aws_cpi/bin/test-integration
  ```
  * Use `RSPEC_ARGUMENTS` to run a subset of tests
    ```bash
    RSPEC_ARGUMENTS=spec/integration/lifecycle_spec.rb:247 src/bosh_aws_cpi/bin/test-integration
    ```
  * Use the `keep-alive` option to keep the terraform environment around even if tests are successful
    ```bash
    src/bosh_aws_cpi/bin/test-integration keep-alive
    ```
  * Use the `destroy` option to destroy the terraform environment without running tests
    ```bash
    src/bosh_aws_cpi/bin/test-integration destroy
    ```


This script will only terraform one environment per workstation. For example,
if your workstation was named `moncada`, it would create a VPC named
`moncada-local-integration` and associated resources.


### Ad-hoc testing

When you need to terraform a VPC but don't need to run tests (e.g. you're deploying a BOSH director for tests), do the following:

* comment-out the last two lines in `src/bosh_aws_cpi/bin/test-integration` (run tests & destroy environment)

```bash
. ~/scratch/aws/lifecycle.env
src/bosh_aws_cpi/bin/test-integration
bosh create-env ~/scratch/aws/bosh-minimal.yml \
  -v PublicSubnetID=$(jq -r '.modules[0].outputs.PublicSubnetID.value' < /tmp/integration-terraform-state-us-west-1.tfstate) \
  -v DeploymentEIP=$(jq -r '.modules[0].outputs.DeploymentEIP.value' < /tmp/integration-terraform-state-us-west-1.tfstate) \
  -v access_key_id=$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID \
  -v secret_access_key=$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```
* run `src/bosh_aws_cpi/bin/test-integration`

### Rubymine support

Given the `Bosh Release` nature of this project, the ruby project content is under `src/bosh_aws_cpi` which does not
work for RubyMine when trying to locate the Gemfile to run the RSpec tests.  To resolve this you can modify the
RubyMine project in the following way:

- Edit `Project Structure`
  - Go To: `Preferences` -> `Project: [project name]` -> `Project Structure`
  - Remove the existing Content Root which would by default be the Projects root
  - Add a new Context Root for each of the projects root folders except for `src`
  - Add a new Content Root `src/bosh_aws_cpi`
  - Select the `src/bosh_aws_cpi` content root and add the `spec` sub-folder as a `Tests` source
  - Save and exit the `Preferences` dialogue
- Edit `The default RSpec Run Configuration`
  - Open `Edit Configurations` dialog
  - Go into `defaults` -> `RSpec`
    - Go to the `Bundler` tab
      - ensure 'Run the script in the context of the bundle (bundle exec)' is checked
    - Go to the `Configuration` tab
      - set the `Working Directory` value to the path to `[project root]/src/bosh_aws_cpi`
    - Remove an temporary Rspec configurations that exist to ensure new defaults are applied to all test
    - Save and exit the `Run Configurations` dialogue
- Run a focused RSpec test to verify it works.
